blocked fg too uncommon?

Just started playing the other day and it's pretty fun! A lot different than BBGM but the roster management is fun even if the games can feel kind of random. Few things stood out. Not sure if this is just for balance purposes, but teams are WAY stricter about giving up next year's 1st round picks than in real life. I can package 3 amazing players and the best I get offered is a 1st 4 years in the future. Meanwhile IRL 1st rounders get traded for much less (Cooper for a 1st straight up).

Also I wonder if there is a way to present a player's value in regards to the position they play. What I mean is if I want to draft a good RB in the game I have to invest an early pick, but in the NFL teams find starting RBs day 3 on a pretty regular basis (although the argument there is OL is more important for the run game than the RB) so that might actually be pretty complicated to implement.

Finally I saw dumbmatter mention this in the initial post, but there really should be guaranteed rookie contracts. They are basically standard in the NFL and I don't see why a simulation wouldn't mirror this. Just feels weird all my players only want 2 year contracts when they are usually stuck with the team for 4 years at least. Just some initial thoughts, great work overall!

keyStats for OL should not show tiny # of tackles

Great players retire too early

rookie contracts too high still?

situationally aware play calling
- pass or run, hurry up or milk the clock with lead
- kneeling to run out clock
- clocking ball to stop clock
- hail mary as a separate play type?
  - needTouchdown

if paying a lot to a QB already, don't sign another expensive one

Also I just had my rookie QB get onto the All-Rookie Team in the QB slot, but he was also slotted in as an All-Rookie punter, without having done any punts all season.

stat distribution pages

too many players playing both offense and defense
- reassess after making roster construction better. if it's still a problem, only allow starter at one position
- too many fat guys with elite speed, small guys with elite strength?

weight formula is not very good

confirm subscription works from football-gm.com
- Basketball GM Gold -> GM Gold, BBGM Commissioner -> The Commissioner in bbgm-account
- cross promote in welcome emails

redo pot formulas?

why is free agency so slow?

button on free agents screen to fill out roster with players making up to 2x the minimum

update these files in football
- newSchedule, newSchedule.test

get ads set up
- banner
- gcs

exportPlayerGamesCsv only supports basketball currently, and it's disabled in ExportStats.js. football box scores are more complicated, more derived stats

use PLAYER_STATS_TABLES for shot locations
- then DRY exportPlayerAveragesCsv, see comment there

way to specify routes for ShotLocations/RosterContinuity/Depth, so they aren't included in football/basketball routes

statistical feats

make roster page reorderable like in football mogul
- it can update t.depth behind the scenes

game sim
- pick playType from (down, toGo, scrimmage, score, quarter, time)
- later
  - clock
    - pace
    - clock management, strategy
  - for 2 point conversions and extra points, penalties don't actually move scrimmage currently!
  - log clutch plays
  - blocked fg
    - count as missed field goal
    - chance for either team to return (very slim for offense)
  - blocked punt
  - missed fg/xp return

league leaders recorded in awards
- see leagueLeaders call in doAwards, needs categories

AV advanced stat
- use in value?
- OL and defense
  - need all pro modifier - but this is circular reasoning, since that comes from AV!
  - in individualPts, check if they actually seem to apply (no substantial rushing/receiving/passing stats)

what's the end state here? options:
- everything is in deion, and process.env.SPORT governs the output
  - that'd be nice, but probably unrealistic
- define minimal set of things that need to be overridden, and pass to deion like new DeionUI({...}) - probably this one!!!!!!!
  - e.g. views.. put routes.js and views/index.js in deion. but views/index.js will only have common ones. for others, pass into DeionUI, and reference both sets of views in genPage in routes.js
  - do this, but try to also do the process.env.SPORT solution when possible
- deion remains a set of functions/classes/modules, to be pulled in externally piecemeal. if something internal needs to be overriden, make it generic or a factory or DI or have it accept a parameter to allow overriding

injuries
- make more representative of football: https://footballplayershealth.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/06_Ch2_Injuries.pdf

how to get types working, options:
- make anything depending on an override or sport-sepcific type into a factory function or generic, initialized in deionWorker or deionUI and then passed around
- pass around overrides manually everywhere, not making it a module
- move everything inside deion

how will deionUI(overrides) work with types?
- can pass them as generics, then apply them to factory functions
- Import modules from deion. Add things like extra views. Apply factories/generics.

type better
- skills/compositeRatings - should be RatingsKey, not string for components. And PlayerRatings
- PlayerStatType should be sport specific
- getCopy/getCopies and Cache
  - awards should return Awards
  - players and playersPlus - Player<> and Player<MinimalPlayerRatings> should be Player<PlayerRatings>
- most MinimalPlayerRatings uses should be generic and take PlayerRatings

names distribution

football league-schema.json

split more from deion
- processInputs for views only in one sport (depth, shot locations)
- worker API functions only in one sport (depth)

yarn workspaces
- see branch football-yarn-workspaces - all works except karma

tests still running within deion? e.g. common/helpers.test.js

better football schedule

better football player names

show game stats in player page

contract demands and position assignments should be based on which position maximizes p.value, not which position maximizes ovr. would you rather have an 80 ovr qb or a 100 ovr kicker?

RatingsOverview - could put in deion, with config to specify categories and names from getCols
- RatingsForm has this already! re-use

god mode options for foul rate and foul outs - Jlebron13 on discord
- other sport specific options, like shot tendencies, enabling/disabling 3 pointers, etc

during free agency, after you sign all your free agents it should automatically take you to the league free agents and skip the step of having to continue

if a trade is highly unfavorable to the user, pop up a warning confirmation dialog

live game
- field with drive summary, football, direction, and last play

more accurage game sim
- State machine. Simulate flags. Distinguish scrimmage and ball position. Transaction rollbacks

---

update discord links after creating football channel

draft lottery teams should only be non-playoff teams

in table, sort position by constants.POSITIONS order (like roster page in football)

revise re-signing - too many good young players become FAs

everywhere contract is displayed, make it in italics if not guaranteed
- currently only on roster i think. make a component!

Add playoff seed # to the history page

on past season rosters, highlight hall of fame players

add end of game to live game sim in basketball, like it is for football

option to have no draft, players just become FAs

customizable columns in DataTable would be great... especially for football, with presets like mogul

"Shot Locations" should be just another stat type in player/team stats
- need to handle super cols in PLAYER_STATS_TABLES

if an ad blocker is used, no need to save that space on the right
- already done for Gold/localhost in initAds, but how to do it for ad blocker too?

open dashboard, open league in new tab, now shell on dashboard is as if in league
- happens because there is no way to distinguish "local.updateGameAttributes called to initialize new league that the user clicked from the dashboard in this tab" and "local.updateGameAttributes called from another tab, but this tab has lid === undefined so we'll leave it in that state"

login -> account -> doesn't say logged in, sometimes? but account shows in navbar
- happens if you log in in one tab while having another open, then in the 2nd tab go to achievements
  - only in firefox?
  - no, user says chrome too

service worker - workbox
- more explicit upgrades https://deanhume.com/displaying-a-new-version-available-progressive-web-app/
  - workbox-window

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/

after preseason, after player development, recalculate player value
- use ovr vs PER formula, but with offset based on prior value

Don't allow play if versions in tabs don't match
- close worker?

---

better table sorting (don't use hack of looking at child)
- DraftAbbrev
- NegotiateButtons (search for negotiate/refuses)

finals home court advantage should be based on record, not seed

user reports - JS alert/confirm often fail on iOS. maybe rewrite with my own modal

redo mood system
- make available throughout the year
  - have deterministic noise, so it can be recomputed constantly as the situation changes
- make it impossible to refuse to re-sign to title winner (really)

fix contracts old players too cheap

Difficulty fudge factor should only be for user team (finances, trades)
- for trades this is hard because valueChange does not know if it's the user's team or not, need to accept another parameter

re-evaluate contracts
- somehow market based

get rid of owner messages, replace with owner status page showing mood directly (bar chart)

make AI smarter about contracts
- then do cool shit, like a tunable "randomness" factor or something that lets you tune player development, and also overall talent level, and also distribution of different ratings (to sim different eras)

ui/api/setGameAttributes logic should be in worker, not ui. minimize transfer

somewhere, show average age of team

increase PG cutoff
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8lfyuh/7_center_turns_into_pg_when_the_season_starts/

option to edit AI trade rate https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8kqzl9/trade_frequency/

index updating
- currenty: check if the indexed property has changed, and only update a specific index then
- would be better: make _dirtyIndexes per index, not per store  
- even better: incrementally update index

later
- in new league: set rookie contracts appropriately
- in new league: initialize rebuilding/contending to non-random values
- don't include core.debug in prod builds?
- steeper penalties for unbalanced lineups
  - increasing perimfactor not enough - need to reevaluate formula. see all_bigs.json
    - perimfactor shouldn't be needed. just use the synergy stuff. should be offense and defense. check values for normal and extreme teams
- simulate draft from past seasons, to correctly assign contracts (don't need to populate actual draft info)

NEED TO FIX TRADE AI
- make tests of trades that should/shouldn't happen

no POT mode, to make it harder

p.valueWithContract is exactly equal to p.value currently!

team shot locations playoffs
- share code with team stats for highlighting and playoff W/L

persist fantasy draft results
- make an array of draft results
- viewable somehow - need to track when fantasy drafts happened and add them to draft results menu

---

more flexible auto play - shorter period of time, individual phases, etc. would require non-alert dialog

1. If there was a "select all" for not including draft picks in trades. So instead of going down 1 by 1 to check don't include you could just say NO to trading any of your 4,000 picks. 

2. If searching player rating also included contracts. Usually you'll want to find a high potential guy on a cheap contract.

open multiple leagues from dashboard at the same time - Invalid cache status "filling"
- looks like flush is being called while status is "filling", can that be short circuited since idb.cache has been redefined? lid is different, or the hostID is different?
  - happens because it calls "flush" when closing an existing open database. should be more explicit about state of loading (no league loaded or loading, league X loaded and no league loading, league X loaded and league Y loading, no league loaded and league Y loading)
  - then will also need a way to prevent UI errors, if a UI update function is running and expects e.g. g to be populated but it's not - UI should check the aforementioned state as well and wait for loaded

reevaluate FA system - too easy to rebuild
- too many young stars available
- first pick at most players

move react up, before worker is initialized, so compareVersions error can be displayed there

somehow display synergy, maybe on roster page

watch list players should result in notifications when things happen (FA salary drops, trades, signings, release, retire)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7h3eqy/simple_feature_request/

advanced team stats
- strength of schedule: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9e6d.html?p=37&cpage=1
  - to set up this system of equations, need to know the schedule, but that is not stored anywhere currently. need to persist original schedule. maybe only soft delete games as they are played, or copy to another table?
  - use https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-solve to solve
- team ortg/drtg/nrtg adjusted for strength of schedule

box plus/minus
- https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html
  - already have everything from "Raw BPM" formula (ReMPG is MP/(G+4))
  - for "BPM_Team_Adjustment", need team net rating (off rating - def rating). The sum term needs all players who played on a team this season, even if they are no longer on the team (annoying to implement, but doable)
    - net rating needs to be adjusted for SOS!
- VORP

advanced stat table too confusing? needs vertical dividers/spacing?

use something besides PER in player value formula

new adv stats in roster page?
- switch PER to WS/48 - roster.js now pulling both, then eventually switch Roster.js
- same for HoF
- OR, wait for BPM?

customizable columns in datatable
- get rid of supercols where possible, like bbr
- for supercols, instead of colspan, pass a list of column names (need to get rid of repeats like raw % first)
  - won't work when there are duplicates. instead needs to be a hierarchy. maybe just pass hierarchy with names, and do getCols in DataTable? but then how to pass extra props like width, is that really needed?
    - search through, find any weird ones, try to eliminate:
      - Draft - setting width, and splicing for fantasy draft
      - PowerRankings - setting width
      - TeamFinances - dynamically use years
      - TeamRecords - some overrides
      - Trade, TradingBlock - override for "" column
  - crazy idea: pass cols only as keys in data (change array -> object), and for supercols prefix like SuperCol|Col
  - or in cols array, add prop to denote supercols
- pass additional parameter containing which columns are visible, by name (if none, then assume all)
- get rid of search
- sortBy by name, not index
- button to reset datatable
- store all datatable params in one localstorage object
- always return all stats and ratings?

all caps columns, like b-r
- PPG -> Pts, probably

per 100 possessions and totals toggle on team stats page

remove babel plugins

remove polyfilles
- get rid of getAll polyfill when safari 10.x usage goes to 0
- others too!

keep box scores with feats

add franchise leaders (stats) to team history page

option to equalize cities when starting new league (equal spending and size)

marker for feats from the playoffs/finals https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/6gpf1f/suggestion_a_marker_of_some_sort_next_to_game/

some way to see draft picks by team, now that there are AI trades

AI trades
- notification? only for big trades. quantify! maybe show that info in transactions page too

AI propose trade to user
- need way to show popup with link to trade page

colors
- color ratings on ratings page (and tables), just like ratings popup
- color stats in ratings popover

filtering
- disable in some columns, like "Negotiate" buttons. maybe config in getCols?

force single tab per league
- when < 5 seconds, wait for another heartbeat before deciding
- check for collission in setInterval, and somehow show error page if that happens

shared worker
- namespace stuff, after it's working for one league
  - attach lid to promiseWorker instance in host (call it "metadata"), update lid if it changes, and attach to every request from host
    - then from worker, pass into toUI
  - query API: flag to determine if broadcast or single response. default single response. optional last arg, so single response use case is same API as now
    - if broadcast, then response is always undefined
    - broadcast needs to be namespaced, too. like only "update all league 5" not "update all tabs open in every league"
      - figure out some way to abstract... like maybe a conditional broadcast function defined based on metadata
  - namespace leagues (or force only one league)
    - namespace locks, g (in worker only), idb.league, and idb.cache
    - all common functions, accept g as param
    - something to handle init/close of tabs
    - look at all toUI calls
  - disconnect league when none are left registered to promise worker (so need api to get all metadata)

when dirty on close, show warning window, and initiate flush (if not already in progress)
- hard to coordinate across UI and worker...

better loading screen, after React takes control but before initial page is rendered - because it can be slow for loading a league

this shit is UGLY UGLY UGLY, fix ASAP!!!
    if (typeof it === 'function') { return; }
  http://railsware.com/blog/2017/01/10/mocking-es6-module-import-without-dependency-injection/

rethink cache API, with goal of having it typed
- rename indexes, store prefixed with storename
- get rid of new any types in types.js

error page (like invalid pid) should show league UI if in league

should checks to update data in worker/views be in worker, or could they be in UI somehow and avoid call to worker if update not needed?

if i can gracefully handle absence of g.season etc, put cache creation inside connectLeague
- not graceful now, see fill(season)

get tests working
- db.getCopy.teams
  - operate on individual functions? can export them just for tests
  - confirm operations that don't require IDB
  - confirm getAll updates from cache

how do caches based on g.season work in preseason?

refactor
- clear, delete need to handle indexes

document cache data format and API!
- different things are cached, depending on object store
- all modifications go into cache
- cache mutations are dangerous, see getCopy
- read from just the cache if you're sure everything is there (like an active player). otherwise, read from db and augment with cache (because anything could be in cache, even if it's not normally.. like retired player added to watch list). getCopy variables do this
- promise microtask worker crap - for firefox support, if you start a backboard tx manually, you can't do any promise/asyncawait stuff inside the callback

event log refactor
- react
- keep state just on worker
- "event log" page with ALL events, should be impossible to "miss" an event

data table sorting shouldn't be based on children
- would allow sorting by checked/unchecked for trade and trading block
- get rid of awkward children stuff - PlayerNameLabels, mood, ...

      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)
    probably will need to increase synergyFactor
    might need to tweak some probabilities if this changes stats too much
    redo ovr formula
    decrease importance of height: https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/6rg7yr/height_is_too_impactful_in_bbgm/

Make AI smarter when constructing teams. Then, if that works, make synergy more impactful

  what do i link to? Imgur landing page? or include social links directly?
    include social links directly. actually that should be the first-level UI - you don't click "Screenshot" you click "Share to X" where X is Twitter, FB, Reddit, etc
      probably still save to imgur first
      autocomplete wording: "Draft players, manage teams, go for the championship. How good a Basketball GM are you? Find out at http://basketball-gm.com"
      also autocomplete hashtag
  add prompts to take screenshots at various points
  things can get cut off right, like wide tables in player pages

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT REVAMP
-------------------------

shouldn't have literally every aging player turn into a great shooter

old players are currently undervalued

Too many good free agents available at the minimum: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2sxs4l/love_the_game_suggestion_for_free_agency/

TEAM.VALUECHANGE REVAMP
-----------------------

https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/585af3/the_trade_ai_is_too_easy_to_abuse/
loyalty: players should be reluctant to leave teams they've been on for a while.
http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2v26p1/how_are_you_exploiting_the_trade_ai/
http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/255sta/i_think_we_need_longer_dynasty_achievements/che050a?context=3
IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
second round draft picks are undervalued. also, giving away a pick should never make a trade worse, but sometimes it does now. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bg3zx/simple_feature_mark_players_as_offlimits_when_we/cj5ap89
  similarly, trading block for nothing can net you second round picks
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

notification system
  customize: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1re3ea/new_feature_notification_bubbles/cdmjdyn
  "healed" should show after game, not before
  when fading out, hover should stop animation, remove notification-delete, reset timer to 1s (or something)
    hover on fading in should also stop animation so there is no stutter
  what about for small screens? maybe just show one at a time. is this actually a problem?
  also log these events:
    fired - log, but don't show
    new team
  notify
    when something happens to a player on the watch list
    big AI moves - trades, free agent signings
  merge "retired" and "HOF" notifications for a player on the user's team

unlimited draft class support
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2ajw7c/about_custom_draft/civz0n6
  take this opportunity to add some stuff to gameAttributes too
trading block should allow for multiple (different) offers from the same team
display of relative ratings like https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/144a4a04330edf3d
trade improvements
  refactor trade module with all the below in mind
    clean up even more?
      should create and updatePlayers be merged? updatePlayers already updates tids too
      either way, they should take partial objects and fill in the default/existing values
  trade suggestions (and trading block) should know salary rules
    HOW?
    team.valueChange could be made fast if I allow an extra argument to pass pre-fetched values from the database
    quick fix: check box to only look for teams under the cap http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qh107/proposed_trades_question/
  trades between AI teams
    call team.checkRosterSizes after this if it's in between days
team switching after being fired
  keep track of what team the user controlled, so stats for the user (not the team) can be shown
random events
  like.. player gets suspended, out X games. or player gets into fight, fan support drops. etc.
more detailed draft - slower picks, trades, etc.
  slower picks http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r70dv/trade_picks_during_draft
  sort by generic value (current) or team-specific value
  trade picks - note that the code in teamValue will need to be modified to account for the lottery and available players in the draft class
power rankings
  preseason too
  awards watch
contests: post roster file and goal

BIG NEW GAMEPLAY CHANGES
------------------------

Extended free agency
  order of AI team signings shouldn't be linear
  0 year contracts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1p0sa8/new_feature_extended_free_agency/ccy4gvp
  AI teams can release players to sign a better free agent?
fix contracts, signing
  goal: reasonable total payrolls, no good free agents left every season
  if WS distribution matches NBA, then look at $ vs WS. even better, build a multivariate model with age
  contracts should take ratings into more account, since stats on a good team are inflated and stats on a bad team are depressed
  player contract amounts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kj0p0/can_i_turn_off_firing/cbpxjyj?context=3
gameSim
  mediocre three point shooters should shoot it less http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bwvpj/psa_players_who_shouldnt_shoot_3s_continue_to/
  smart substitutions http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9w78/went_7012_with_this_roster_is_this_really_that/cj3zgui
  big men should score more, shoot more FTs http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2amqpo/how_come_all_of_the_top_scorers_are_always_3_guys/
  pos/neg effects add on like civ4 defensive bonuses?
  balance http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jfcjw/game_imbalance_fc_with_rdi/ http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1097mj
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbfzr43?context=3 http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k1881/pf_stands_for_powerful/
    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)
add free agent to the end of roster
mode with ratings hidden
  implement like fuzz?
  maybe use very rough letter grades like A/B/C/D/F to replace the ratings
"My Player" mode http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2swmwj/there_should_be_a_game_like_myplayer_in_2k/cntkvj4

MINOR FIXES
-----------

show team records in box score http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2dkpzw/request_team_record_in_box_scores/
retired players should be eligible for season awards
documentation
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2agxoe/questions_and_suggestions_from_a_new_player/
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
Make good young players much less likely to become FAs
show team records in playoffs, conference standings
don't need to store abbrev with awards, just tids
  fix display in season summary (correct in historyAll)
show team records in playoffs page
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
Add markers for clinching playoffs / 1st seed in league standings
league leaders glitch http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r20x5/league_leaders_bug/
merge game.play and freeAgents.play
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked
UI to easily switch between conference and division standings on small screens and dashboard http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2d4o9r/feature_requests_of_the_week_august_10_2014/cjqrwtf?context=3
schedule page (and dashboard and maybe gamelog) should show opponent records
add "play until end of quarter" in live gamesim

LOW PRIORITY
------------

awards races throughout the season
track longest W/L streaks
tooling
  istanbul https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage
team chemistry http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2oco2a/simple_suggestion_team_chemistry/cmrpap6?context=3
use compound index on season + team for games obectStore in helpers.gameLogList, views.leagueDashboard, maybe elsewhere
upcoming free agents page should show at least some information about signings (or non-signings) during re-sign phase
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"

  show awards count in hall of fame
add numbers for players
  ability to retire numbers
fantasy draft
  when fantasy draft is over, go to summary of the draft
    do this in core.draft.untilUserOrEnd
  add entry for fantasy draft summary to draft history dropdown?
league settings
  enable/disable trading rules
cross-league play
mobile UI, bootstrap 3
  do something about hover tooltips
    injury
    skills
      for injury and skills, maybe make the whole block a hyperlink that opens a popover
        make sure to use on player page too.. can i use helpers.playerName.. there too?
    table headers
    others?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
luxury tax money should be redistributed to non-taxpaying teams (or teams under the cap?)
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
better core.player.ovr formula
  regression: player = require('core/player'); player.regressRatingsPer();
    weight by minutes played
  THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WHEN PLAYER GENERATION/DEVELOPMENT OR GAMESIM CHANGES!
more detailed player moods - http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k4val/players_refusing_to_sign_bug/cbln1oo?context=3
  player personality, team chemistry
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1tkw3e/idea_player_traits/
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
player morale - punishment for tanking
team colors, and uniforms in player icons
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
more refined control of playing time
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
god mode
  options
    disable ratings display
  edit other player attributes (draft, etc)
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  easily edit in excel?
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
gameSim
  use real clock (this.t) rather than number of possessions
  teams should play quicker as the clock runs out
    more generally, teams should have situational awareness
  more penalty for really unbalanced rosters: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cba743c?context=3
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  bench players should get minutes in blowouts
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
AI teams should periodically reorder rosters throughout the season
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
If you are simulating through the whole season and execute a trade while simulating, it will continue simulating even if you are over the roster limit. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1xch01/trades_after_season/cfamo73
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  https://unhosted.org/adventures/7/Adding-remote-storage-to-unhosted-web-apps.html
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.
live play-by-play simulation
  slow it down http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1pu92x/new_feature_live_playbyplay_simulation/cd6xq54?context=3
  change of possession with no rebound/turnover?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  allow the user to make substitutions in realtime
multi team trades
